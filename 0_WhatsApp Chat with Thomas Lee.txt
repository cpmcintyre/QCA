18/09/2016, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: Still there
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Cameron McIntyre: I wonder what the dynamic between him and Denis is.
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: Umm
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: Cordial
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Cameron McIntyre: That's not usually a good sign.
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: They still joke publicly
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Cameron McIntyre: Fair.
18/09/2016, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: If I wasn't aware of the dispute
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Thomas Lee: I would have never guessed there was an issue
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Cameron McIntyre: Well there isn't a dispute.
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't think.
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Thomas Lee: Just tried to fire
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Cameron McIntyre: But I was getting a weird vibe off Shaun when I last saw him towards Denis.
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Thomas Lee: And Shaun is trying to sue bmo
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Cameron McIntyre: Really? For what?
18/09/2016, 15:00 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: I guess wrongful dismissal
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: But the legal proceedings are taking a long timr
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: Probably up to a year
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Whoa whoah whoah whoah.
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Start from the beginning.
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: Sorry thought you knew
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Nope.
18/09/2016, 15:01 - Thomas Lee: Unfortunately that's all I know
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: Not sure when it happened
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: So they tried to fire Shaun
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: And he sued.
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: I love it
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: Or package him out I guess
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: We are going to talk to George on Monday he'd love to hear It.
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: I guess until they can prove in court that it was justified
18/09/2016, 15:02 - Thomas Lee: Then Shaun walks
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: I wish I knew more
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: Maybe I'll ask around
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: Should have asked Mike before I left
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. That'd be interesting.
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: I wonder if manya knows
18/09/2016, 15:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Good question.
18/09/2016, 15:05 - Thomas Lee: You still talk with Mk?
18/09/2016, 15:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Not really. I'd feel comfortable calling him up and grabbing a coffee tho.
18/09/2016, 15:05 - Cameron McIntyre: How is he taking it?
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: Well
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: Mk is pretty reserved
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: Can be hard to get a read on him
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes.  very.
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: He said he was sad to see me go
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: Which is probably genuine
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: We were joking in the exit interview
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. Mike doesn't lie or kiss assess.
18/09/2016, 15:06 - Cameron McIntyre: He does mean it if he says it.
18/09/2016, 15:07 - Thomas Lee: And he took all my advice for how to improve the group
18/09/2016, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: What were u guys joking about.

18/09/2016, 15:16 - Thomas Lee: I just don't believe it with that pay

18/09/2016, 15:16 - Thomas Lee: Would have thought generally speaking higher pay, higher stress

18/09/2016, 15:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. That sucks.

22/03/2017, 14:01 - Cameron McIntyre: They'd have to, no?

29/06/2017, 22:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeah.
29/06/2017, 22:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Do it.
29/06/2017, 22:48 - Thomas Lee: We'll see
29/06/2017, 22:48 - Thomas Lee: I'm scared to be under Dean
29/06/2017, 22:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Stephen is coming home next week
29/06/2017, 22:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe he will move up.
29/06/2017, 22:52 - Cameron McIntyre: You are a boss
29/06/2017, 22:52 - Cameron McIntyre: How many reports?
29/06/2017, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: Umm
29/06/2017, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: Rojina for now
29/06/2017, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: I don't think Steven reports to me
29/06/2017, 22:53 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
29/06/2017, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: Probably under omaire who will be the other senior
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: We will be consider peers
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: But I don't think he has a manager title
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Who the fuck is omaire?
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: Internal candidate
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: Dfr
29/06/2017, 22:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Weird.
29/06/2017, 22:57 - Thomas Lee: Yrah

29/06/2017, 22:58 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol true. Well played.
29/06/2017, 23:01 - Thomas Lee: You think you will make it to Stevens going away tomorrow?
30/06/2017, 06:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Probably not
30/06/2017, 06:33 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm sick bruh.
30/06/2017, 06:35 - Thomas Lee: you ok?
30/06/2017, 06:35 - Cameron McIntyre: I think so.
30/06/2017, 06:35 - Cameron McIntyre: I just keep getting sick with stuff here.
30/06/2017, 06:36 - Cameron McIntyre: My immune system is shit comparatively here I guess.
30/06/2017, 06:36 - Thomas Lee: new environment
30/06/2017, 06:36 - Thomas Lee: you haven't built up immunity to the slightly different strains of bacteria and viruses
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: i think its too be expected to be honest
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: do you find you are stressed out?
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: that could be suppressing your immune response
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Cameron McIntyre: Fucking all the time.
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: its probably that
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: whats got you down?
30/06/2017, 06:37 - Thomas Lee: work
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Thomas Lee: and social life?
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Cameron McIntyre: I generally have high stress levels.
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. A bit of everything I guess.
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Thomas Lee: do you know what your stressors are?
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Social life is shit
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Thomas Lee: are you worrier?
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Nope.
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Cameron McIntyre: I think being sick or hurt gets me down also.
30/06/2017, 06:38 - Thomas Lee: makes sense

30/06/2017, 06:42 - Thomas Lee: eat good food
30/06/2017, 06:42 - Thomas Lee: self doubt
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: in terms of
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: well everything
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: competence
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: confidence
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: appearance
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: intelligence
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Appearance and intelligence aren't an issue
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Cameron McIntyre: You have those
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Cameron McIntyre: How is your uti?
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: seems to be ok
30/06/2017, 06:43 - Thomas Lee: i was chugging on cranberry juice
30/06/2017, 06:44 - Thomas Lee: the frequent urination stopped
30/06/2017, 06:44 - Thomas Lee: and the sensitivity is gone
30/06/2017, 06:44 - Thomas Lee: bladder sensitivity is gone too
30/06/2017, 06:44 - Thomas Lee: can't say how much was psychological though
30/06/2017, 06:44 - Thomas Lee: probably all
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Cameron McIntyre: It's good that it's gone.
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Thomas Lee: do you drink coffee on a daily basis?
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Cameron McIntyre: It could have been anything.
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeah.
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Thomas Lee: you may want to try to get rid of it
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Cameron McIntyre: I 😍 coffee
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Thomas Lee: and switch to water instead
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Thomas Lee: i do too
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeah?
30/06/2017, 06:45 - Thomas Lee: but its a stressor
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: yeah
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: caffeine to be specific
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: spikes cortisol
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: the stress hormone
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: so if you and I are sensitive to stress
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: we may have to look to anything that can elevate those levels
30/06/2017, 06:46 - Thomas Lee: but i think our main problem is perception
30/06/2017, 06:47 - Thomas Lee: how we see the world and how we interpret others actions towards us and their environments
30/06/2017, 06:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Perception is an issue.
30/06/2017, 06:48 - Cameron McIntyre: I definitely am a negative nancy
30/06/2017, 06:48 - Thomas Lee: its hard to re-wire
30/06/2017, 06:48 - Thomas Lee: everytime i try
30/06/2017, 06:49 - Thomas Lee: i will find something to postiive reinforce my negative views
30/06/2017, 06:49 - Cameron McIntyre: And the cortisol affect fat storage right
30/06/2017, 06:49 - Thomas Lee: yep
30/06/2017, 06:49 - Thomas Lee: hormones are tricky
30/06/2017, 06:49 - Thomas Lee: they hit everything
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Thomas Lee: and chronic suffering is much worse
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Thomas Lee: another thing is sleep too
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Cameron McIntyre: True
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Thomas Lee: regular sleep schedules help
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Thomas Lee: that extra boost in structured living is valuable
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Thomas Lee: look at the military
30/06/2017, 06:50 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: creates very healthy individuals
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: body and mind
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Cameron McIntyre: I need my sleep routines.
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm already like an insomniac
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Cameron McIntyre: I keep to them pretty well tho
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: gotta follow the sun
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: drop the phone
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: keep it far away
30/06/2017, 06:51 - Thomas Lee: one the screen is bad
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Thomas Lee: but 2, apparently the emf can be bad potentially too
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Cameron McIntyre: Whats emf?
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Thomas Lee: some people will actually turn their phones off
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Thomas Lee: electromagnetic field
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Thomas Lee: i was reading some articles about it
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Thomas Lee: so you have things like phones and fitness trackers
30/06/2017, 06:52 - Cameron McIntyre: Ahh. I think is kind of hypochondriac
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Thomas Lee: they may not be so good for sleep tracking as they could potentially interfere with sleep patterns
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Cameron McIntyre: We go through tons of magnetic fields all the time.
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Cameron McIntyre: It's a theory
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Cameron McIntyre: It's hard to prove.
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Thomas Lee: whether its a real thing or placebo
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Thomas Lee: doens't actually matter
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Thomas Lee: the effect is still the same
30/06/2017, 06:53 - Thomas Lee: perception is probably much worse than actual reality
30/06/2017, 06:54 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
30/06/2017, 06:54 - Cameron McIntyre: There's a point to that
30/06/2017, 06:55 - Thomas Lee: i was watching an episode of bill nye's new serioes on netflix
30/06/2017, 06:55 - Thomas Lee: they talk about the placebo and nocebo effect
30/06/2017, 06:55 - Cameron McIntyre: Any good?
30/06/2017, 06:55 - Thomas Lee: pretty interest stuff
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea placebo effect is real.
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Thomas Lee: i honestly was watching it passively
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Thomas Lee: hard to really grab my full attention nowadays
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Thomas Lee: it definitely is
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Thomas Lee: actually measureable
30/06/2017, 06:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. It's real!
30/06/2017, 06:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Damn. I was going to say something.
30/06/2017, 06:57 - Cameron McIntyre: But I forgot.
30/06/2017, 06:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Who does Steven report to now?
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Thomas Lee: I think Dean
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Cameron McIntyre: Weird.
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Thomas Lee: When the new senior comes he will roll up to them I believe
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Thomas Lee: Could still be Greg at the moment
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Cameron McIntyre: When a dog licks you does that mean he likes you?
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Thomas Lee: Not entirely sure
30/06/2017, 06:59 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
30/06/2017, 07:00 - Thomas Lee: Generally yes
30/06/2017, 07:00 - Thomas Lee: I think for the dog question

30/06/2017, 07:01 - Cameron McIntyre: I thought he was trying to taste what ihad eaten before.
30/06/2017, 07:01 - Thomas Lee: Could be part of it
30/06/2017, 07:01 - Thomas Lee: But hey don't have to be mutually exclusive
30/06/2017, 07:01 - Thomas Lee: They*

15/09/2017, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: What is?
15/09/2017, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: so i had a meeting yesterday to get a core estimate on OIS late

15/09/2017, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: ois lite*
15/09/2017, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: but
15/09/2017, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea, and?
15/09/2017, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: they basically are giving me one day
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: and the estimate is all based on what greg has done and knows
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: problem i have is
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: sometimes it can be difficult to reach greg
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: so 1 day lead time is not really good
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: but whatever
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: sure can make it happen but foresight would have been nice
15/09/2017, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Who is asking for the estimate.

15/09/2017, 13:14 - Cameron McIntyre: Honestly. It's not as high stress as u make it.
15/09/2017, 14:13 - Cameron McIntyre: We can talk about school outside work.

15/09/2017, 14:33 - Cameron McIntyre: No I don't think it was that big.
15/09/2017, 14:34 - Cameron McIntyre: But it still sucks.
15/09/2017, 14:34 - Cameron McIntyre: At any point
15/09/2017, 14:34 - Cameron McIntyre: I could be on the subway. And boom.
15/09/2017, 14:35 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
15/09/2017, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: Definitely aonga
15/09/2017, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: Sucks*

02/11/2017, 14:49 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Sounds pretty badass.
02/11/2017, 14:49 - Thomas Lee: If anything I don't like the announcement
02/11/2017, 14:49 - Cameron McIntyre: I would change it to something more like

02/11/2017, 14:55 - Thomas Lee: He will complain about scope everyday
02/11/2017, 14:55 - Thomas Lee: And changing estimates
02/11/2017, 14:55 - Thomas Lee: Basically is just lazy
02/11/2017, 14:55 - Thomas Lee: Some stuff is legitmate
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: Most is noise though
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol true.
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude.
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Cameron McIntyre: We are paid to work. So let's work. Know what I mean.
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Not paid to complain.
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: I honestly don't give a shit about funding and timesheets
02/11/2017, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: Do your job
02/11/2017, 14:57 - Thomas Lee: That's it
02/11/2017, 14:57 - Thomas Lee: If PM's are pushing too much
02/11/2017, 14:57 - Thomas Lee: Fine
02/11/2017, 14:58 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
02/11/2017, 14:58 - Cameron McIntyre: Well maybe that's the attitude we need.
02/11/2017, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: I think he doesn't roll to me
02/11/2017, 14:59 - Cameron McIntyre: What do u mean roll?
02/11/2017, 15:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Im so close to just shutting down.
02/11/2017, 15:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Like. I'm about to kick off over some stupid issue.
02/11/2017, 15:05 - Thomas Lee: Report
02/11/2017, 15:07 - Thomas Lee: What's the issue
02/11/2017, 15:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Essentially. I want to build the Tableau off of 2 tables. It makes sense and it works. However, kushal said to do it off a different two tables.
02/11/2017, 15:09 - Cameron McIntyre: And Ed is obvi pushing his boss's agenda
02/11/2017, 15:09 - Cameron McIntyre: And I'm like fuck that.
02/11/2017, 15:09 - Cameron McIntyre: It's unnecessary.
02/11/2017, 15:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Overly complicated and prone to being fucked up.
02/11/2017, 15:10 - Thomas Lee: Hmm
02/11/2017, 15:10 - Thomas Lee: Don't you want my involvement
02/11/2017, 15:10 - Thomas Lee: Do you*
02/11/2017, 15:10 - Thomas Lee: ?
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Not yet.
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Hopefully not.
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Ed fights Kushal back for me for some of my concerns
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Ok
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Do you have email chains?
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Forward if you do
02/11/2017, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: But I have the poc prototype working in the way I have designed it.
02/11/2017, 15:13 - Thomas Lee: How much rework
02/11/2017, 15:13 - Thomas Lee: In terms of time?
02/11/2017, 15:15 - Cameron McIntyre: Dont know don't care.
02/11/2017, 15:16 - Cameron McIntyre: If they ask me for the spec of how to do it they shouldn't come back and challenge me on what I am doing. It's a functional working model.
02/11/2017, 15:16 - Cameron McIntyre: Why change anything??
02/11/2017, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: I guess strategic view vs timelines
02/11/2017, 15:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Its honestly more like "I think this will work" -kushal
02/11/2017, 15:36 - Cameron McIntyre: And I'm like "this will work let's do it this way"
02/11/2017, 15:43 - Thomas Lee: Kushal doesn't always make the right call
02/11/2017, 16:08 - Cameron McIntyre: 👍🏻
07/11/2017, 14:21 - Cameron McIntyre: I made Steven laugh in an email.
07/11/2017, 14:22 - Thomas Lee: WHAT!!!
07/11/2017, 14:22 - Thomas Lee: See
07/11/2017, 14:22 - Thomas Lee: You are a gebius
07/11/2017, 14:22 - Thomas Lee: Genius*
07/11/2017, 14:23 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol. Just write short choppy sentences. He understands that.
07/11/2017, 14:24 - Thomas Lee: Haha
07/11/2017, 14:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol.

04/12/2017, 16:30 - Cameron McIntyre: U there?
04/12/2017, 16:30 - Cameron McIntyre: I have a confession to make before u become my manager for real.
04/12/2017, 16:33 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
04/12/2017, 16:33 - Thomas Lee: What's up
04/12/2017, 16:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Ok last week
04/12/2017, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: When I was working from home.
04/12/2017, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: I literally went to this girls house and fucked all afternoon.
04/12/2017, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: I didn't miss my call.
04/12/2017, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: But I was getting my dick sucked during the call.
04/12/2017, 16:35 - Thomas Lee: Lol
04/12/2017, 16:36 - Cameron McIntyre: And I'm afraid I can't tell you these things when you are manager.
04/12/2017, 16:36 - Thomas Lee: I'm afraid of the new relationship as well
04/12/2017, 16:36 - Thomas Lee: Honestly
04/12/2017, 16:36 - Thomas Lee: Don't like it
04/12/2017, 16:36 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea?
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Thomas Lee: Plus I feel you should have the role not me
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Cameron McIntyre: Fuck. Why?
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Thomas Lee: More senior
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Cameron McIntyre: U r actually around the humans that you are managing.
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Thomas Lee: I know
04/12/2017, 16:37 - Thomas Lee: But stilo
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Thomas Lee: I understand the geographical limitations
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Thomas Lee: But still
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude. The world doesn't run on seniority.
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Take the cash. Take the opportunity and run with it.
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Cameron McIntyre: If u don't like It quit.
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Go somewhere else.
04/12/2017, 16:38 - Cameron McIntyre: And make some real cashhhh.
04/12/2017, 16:39 - Thomas Lee: Cash was bad
04/12/2017, 16:40 - Thomas Lee: It's not all seniority
04/12/2017, 16:40 - Cameron McIntyre: How bad?
04/12/2017, 16:40 - Thomas Lee: But you are than that
04/12/2017, 16:40 - Thomas Lee: 10k bump
04/12/2017, 16:40 - Thomas Lee: I'll leave in 1yr

04/12/2017, 16:42 - Cameron McIntyre: Id quit by may.
04/12/2017, 16:42 - Thomas Lee: I'm already not thrilled about this job anyways
04/12/2017, 16:42 - Cameron McIntyre: And slack off untill then.
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Then make the next employer compensate for the bonus.
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: I need to fix our lineage in core
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: Very hard to track ins and outs of core
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Howso?
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. That is true.
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: Forsee is a good start
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: I've been going through confluence after work
04/12/2017, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: Trying together get a better understanding of core
04/12/2017, 16:44 - Thomas Lee: But it's really messy
04/12/2017, 16:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea it is messy.
04/12/2017, 16:44 - Thomas Lee: And I don't want everyone to go to Greg all the time
04/12/2017, 16:44 - Thomas Lee: Not his job
04/12/2017, 16:47 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. But structurally it is built around him.
04/12/2017, 16:47 - Cameron McIntyre: He did it to himself.
04/12/2017, 16:47 - Cameron McIntyre: But I agree with you
04/12/2017, 16:47 - Cameron McIntyre: But it will take years to get turned off of Greg.
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Thomas Lee: He will retire soon too probably
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Cameron McIntyre: Not for 10 more years.
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Thomas Lee: Like 5 yra
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Thomas Lee: Really?

04/12/2017, 16:48 - Thomas Lee: But you never know
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Cameron McIntyre: He has dependents. He is starting to downsize though.
04/12/2017, 16:48 - Thomas Lee: I thought it was too early
04/12/2017, 16:49 - Thomas Lee: Yea
07/12/2017, 17:05 - Thomas Lee: Apparently Glen doesn't like me too much
07/12/2017, 17:05 - Thomas Lee: Doesn't think I deserve the promotion
07/12/2017, 17:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol. Why?
07/12/2017, 17:09 - Thomas Lee: Probably because he thinks I'm stupid
07/12/2017, 17:09 - Thomas Lee: He didn't like what happened for cwd
07/12/2017, 17:09 - Thomas Lee: Kushal was pushing 1 to 1 ingestion of eodc files
07/12/2017, 17:10 - Thomas Lee: So they weren't getting a custom extract
07/12/2017, 17:10 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude.

18/01/2018, 22:50 - Thomas Lee: more than i thought
18/01/2018, 22:50 - Thomas Lee: just feels entitled
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Cameron McIntyre: Howso?
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Thomas Lee: expects to be given a lot of things
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Thomas Lee: that are luxuries not rights
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Thomas Lee: like the WFH thing
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
18/01/2018, 22:51 - Cameron McIntyre: How long is she in uk?

18/01/2018, 22:51 - Cameron McIntyre: Like what?
18/01/2018, 22:52 - Thomas Lee: so
18/01/2018, 22:52 - Thomas Lee: when i was filling out forms for her to get your moved to uk
18/01/2018, 22:52 - Thomas Lee: making a case for raising her expenses to cover more
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: she would suggest tweaking things to get more
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: which were sketchy
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: and outright lies
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Thomas Lee: so its was the cunning that worries me
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Cameron McIntyre: Hmm interesting.
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Cameron McIntyre: Typical Iranian.
18/01/2018, 22:53 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol.

18/01/2018, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: its fine if you are, its a slow day anyways
18/01/2018, 22:54 - Thomas Lee: then she said, she will get a ride to come in
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Thomas Lee: i was ok with her wfh
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Thomas Lee: but
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Thomas Lee: i needed her to see that i'm not a push over
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Thomas Lee: and i do see it
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Cameron McIntyre: So that's basically an admission of guilt.

18/01/2018, 22:55 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.
18/01/2018, 22:55 - Thomas Lee: exactly

18/01/2018, 22:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.

18/01/2018, 22:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
18/01/2018, 22:57 - Thomas Lee: i wish it didn't have to be that way for you

18/01/2018, 22:58 - Cameron McIntyre: I knew I would go through it.
18/01/2018, 22:58 - Cameron McIntyre: It will lead to better things.

18/01/2018, 22:59 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
18/01/2018, 23:00 - Cameron McIntyre: I feel like our job is like a boxer in a fighting ring.
18/01/2018, 23:00 - Cameron McIntyre: He knows he's going to get hit
18/01/2018, 23:00 - Cameron McIntyre: But it'll be fine in the end

24/01/2018, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: But seriously
24/01/2018, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: This is technical specs
24/01/2018, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: Why wouldn't business or ba care
24/01/2018, 17:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea true.
24/01/2018, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: Kushal seems to think requirements automatically mean specs

29/01/2018, 23:16 - Cameron McIntyre: Nope.
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Because if I don't get in I don't want him to know.
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Thomas Lee: True
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Thomas Lee: I don't know if I should talk to greg
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Thomas Lee: Not sure if he will be mad at me
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Because I don't want him to think I'm trying to leave. I dont care about the failure.
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: He won't be
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: He understands
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: He lives for his family.
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Thomas Lee: True
29/01/2018, 23:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Work is challenging and fun
29/01/2018, 23:18 - Cameron McIntyre: But he cares abt family more.

29/01/2018, 23:21 - Cameron McIntyre: He doesnt
29/01/2018, 23:21 - Cameron McIntyre: If anything he has confidence in them

29/01/2018, 23:22 - Thomas Lee: I don't want anything to do with it
29/01/2018, 23:22 - Thomas Lee: I was hoping she would bail
29/01/2018, 23:22 - Cameron McIntyre: She'll prolly want to tear u down or pretend her life is perfect.
29/01/2018, 23:23 - Cameron McIntyre: Just let her do it
29/01/2018, 23:23 - Thomas Lee: Who knows
29/01/2018, 23:23 - Cameron McIntyre: Cant control other people's actions.
29/01/2018, 23:23 - Thomas Lee: My other buddy is telling me to fuck her
29/01/2018, 23:23 - Thomas Lee: It's he other girl who is coming

29/01/2018, 23:23 - Cameron McIntyre: True

29/01/2018, 23:36 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
29/01/2018, 23:36 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't think you will be able to keep going if you keep second guessing yourself.
29/01/2018, 23:37 - Cameron McIntyre: All of your anxieties about what other people think are imagined.
29/01/2018, 23:37 - Cameron McIntyre: No one thinks what you think they think. Especially about your work and skills.
29/01/2018, 23:37 - Cameron McIntyre: You are really good and on top of what you are doing.
29/01/2018, 23:38 - Cameron McIntyre: You are torturing yourself. You aren't very nice to yourself. That's the problem.
29/01/2018, 23:38 - Cameron McIntyre: The job is boring. And can be shitty.
29/01/2018, 23:38 - Thomas Lee: All true statements
29/01/2018, 23:38 - Cameron McIntyre: But you're really good.
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Thomas Lee: I don't want to touch FO because of these fears
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Thomas Lee: Inadequacy
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Thomas Lee: Honestly
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Thomas Lee: Personality might be an issue though
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes man.
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Thomas Lee: Or consulting
29/01/2018, 23:39 - Cameron McIntyre: You'd be a great consultant.
29/01/2018, 23:40 - Thomas Lee: I guess I need the right fit
29/01/2018, 23:40 - Thomas Lee: The right problems to solve
29/01/2018, 23:40 - Thomas Lee: Ones I get up for
29/01/2018, 23:40 - Thomas Lee: Rather than ones that keep me up
29/01/2018, 23:41 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
29/01/2018, 23:41 - Cameron McIntyre: But can you build that into your current setup?
29/01/2018, 23:42 - Thomas Lee: i honestly don't know
29/01/2018, 23:42 - Thomas Lee: I might be impossible now
29/01/2018, 23:42 - Thomas Lee: I might have convinced myself that I need to get out
29/01/2018, 23:43 - Thomas Lee: Feels like that moment I had at bmo
29/01/2018, 23:43 - Thomas Lee: The breaking point
29/01/2018, 23:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Can you use the resources at Rbc to see what you can do
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Like hr.
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Thomas Lee: That's one option
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Thomas Lee: I'm a little worried about doing that too
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Cameron McIntyre: It costs nothing
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Thomas Lee: Dean already got an email from hr
29/01/2018, 23:44 - Cameron McIntyre: And they are there to help

02/02/2018, 13:27 - Thomas Lee: I might come to you for advice on what you would like to see in a catalogue
02/02/2018, 13:27 - Thomas Lee: I'm probably going to use the Otis template as a starting point
02/02/2018, 13:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Thats a good idea
02/02/2018, 13:28 - Cameron McIntyre: How many proj are you on though.
02/02/2018, 13:28 - Cameron McIntyre: That's a lot.
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Imo
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Cameron McIntyre: They need to get the data correct before it hits core.
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Umm
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Core ingestion
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Ois lite
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Dean's thing
02/02/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Now this

02/02/2018, 13:35 - Thomas Lee: Not really
02/02/2018, 13:35 - Thomas Lee: But I think dean is more the type where ifhe says something it's bad news
02/02/2018, 13:35 - Thomas Lee: Otherwise it's all good
02/02/2018, 13:36 - Thomas Lee: I think for the cataloguing I'm gonna approach it in phases with ashley
02/02/2018, 13:36 - Thomas Lee: First is to simple identify downstream usera
02/02/2018, 13:36 - Thomas Lee: Then slowly build out details

09/03/2018, 12:51 - Thomas Lee: Feeling tempted to quit
09/03/2018, 12:52 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea? What's up?
09/03/2018, 12:52 - Thomas Lee: I think shit is hitting the fan
09/03/2018, 12:52 - Thomas Lee: And I'm gonna get shot on for all of it
09/03/2018, 12:52 - Thomas Lee: Just got too many things to do
09/03/2018, 12:53 - Thomas Lee: Can't do any of it right
09/03/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea man. It's can be poorly managed.
09/03/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: You are under a lot of expectations.
09/03/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: But I think u can pull it off
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Have u talked to Dean ? Duncan?
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: I think pms and higher ups have been talking
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: No
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: I was thinking about reaching out to greg
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Talking about what?
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: Just to talk
09/03/2018, 13:06 - Cameron McIntyre: You should. Definitely he gives me advice all the time.
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Thomas Lee: But I really think there is a divide between us now
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Cameron McIntyre: He's been through a million different office politics.
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Cameron McIntyre: There isnt
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Thomas Lee: PMS and higher ups saying I'm not doing well
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Cameron McIntyre: And if there is then close it.
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Thomas Lee: Or saying I'm delaying shit
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Cameron McIntyre: I think you are just being paranoid. That's not coming down the pipe
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Cameron McIntyre: And part of your job is getting their expectations managed.
09/03/2018, 13:07 - Thomas Lee: Well one pm told me direcrly
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Talk to Greg.
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: And that pissed me off
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Whatd they say?
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Which pm?
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: Thing is I can't even talk to Greg easily now
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: Since I'm by Dean and duncan
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: Samad
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Pick up the phone and call.
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Fuck samad.
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: He said I was confusing everyone
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Cameron McIntyre: He's a nobody looking to stir shit up.
09/03/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: Saying things are required when they arent
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: So I didn't blow up
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: But I just asked him
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: Then why is Greg saying the spec needs to change
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: So Greg is handling one part
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: I'm the other
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: Mostly Greg to be honest
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. He's on everything.
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: But I get directly all the questions
09/03/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: Directed*
09/03/2018, 13:10 - Cameron McIntyre: Then say what u can't answer.
09/03/2018, 13:10 - Thomas Lee: Just because Greg is busy
09/03/2018, 13:10 - Thomas Lee: Some of the stuff I feel is the PM's should know
09/03/2018, 13:10 - Thomas Lee: They are guiding the project
09/03/2018, 13:10 - Thomas Lee: So I don't really know why I have to explain things that I have no info of
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: I generally don't answer
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: Or just say what I know
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: But it's just frustrating that this keeps happening
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Cameron McIntyre: I would filter the info going to the PM's.
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: The thing is
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Don't say what u know.
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: The PM's are on more emails then me
09/03/2018, 13:11 - Thomas Lee: So they should know
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Thomas Lee: That shit bothers me
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Then refer them to the emails.
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Thomas Lee: Adnan has been dropping my name to a lot of people lately too
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Thomas Lee: So I'm getting so many random requests
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Thomas Lee: And task force style atuff
09/03/2018, 13:12 - Thomas Lee: But Dean has me heavy in the data validation stuff
09/03/2018, 13:13 - Thomas Lee: He also wanted me to book a huge meeting room on the 12th floor since he couldn't get it to work
09/03/2018, 13:13 - Thomas Lee: Give me 2 days
09/03/2018, 13:13 - Thomas Lee: Turns out you need special permission to book that room
09/03/2018, 13:14 - Thomas Lee: And you need special permission to get a projector as well
09/03/2018, 13:14 - Thomas Lee: All of which after finding the contacts out
09/03/2018, 13:14 - Thomas Lee: It ends up being reserved for finance only
09/03/2018, 13:14 - Thomas Lee: So I was kinda pissed that I got dropped that bomb on top of everything else is do
09/03/2018, 13:15 - Thomas Lee: And it can't go wrong. It's like 25 senior directors from financial control
09/03/2018, 13:15 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude. Let's talk. Just at lunch now.
09/03/2018, 13:15 - Cameron McIntyre: You can do this though.
09/03/2018, 13:16 - Thomas Lee: Apparently I was told when Debbie goes on holiday
09/03/2018, 13:16 - Thomas Lee: I have to look after the Otis group too
09/03/2018, 13:16 - Thomas Lee: Just getting so tired of the shit man
09/03/2018, 13:17 - Thomas Lee: Been asking around about consulting gigs
09/03/2018, 13:17 - Thomas Lee: See if I can handle that
09/03/2018, 13:17 - Thomas Lee: Or go and demote myself to a more relaxed job
09/03/2018, 13:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Sounds like a plan.
09/03/2018, 13:18 - Thomas Lee: I wasn't really looking before
09/03/2018, 13:18 - Thomas Lee: But I think I'm gonna start actively looking
09/03/2018, 13:55 - Cameron McIntyre: U gotta have grit. Perseverance.
09/03/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: If no one is forcing you to leave, then don't.
09/03/2018, 14:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Get on a call with Greg
09/03/2018, 14:02 - Cameron McIntyre: And sort the problems out.
09/03/2018, 14:08 - Thomas Lee: Hey
09/03/2018, 14:08 - Thomas Lee: Thanks for speaking to Greg for me
09/03/2018, 14:09 - Thomas Lee: I really do appreciate it a lot
09/03/2018, 14:09 - Cameron McIntyre: No prob
09/03/2018, 14:09 - Cameron McIntyre: You gotta realize that the solution isn't going to come from you working harder.
09/03/2018, 14:10 - Cameron McIntyre: You need to use the people and infrastructure around you to make it work.
09/03/2018, 14:30 - Cameron McIntyre: And you are not alone b
09/03/2018, 14:31 - Cameron McIntyre: And you can be expected to fix a monster like RBC.
09/03/2018, 19:27 - Cameron McIntyre: U feeling better now?
09/03/2018, 21:31 - Thomas Lee: A little bit
09/03/2018, 21:31 - Thomas Lee: But underlying issues arent
09/03/2018, 21:31 - Thomas Lee: Thanks for asking
09/03/2018, 21:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Let the issues ride
09/03/2018, 21:32 - Cameron McIntyre: It's not your life's purpose to solve them.
09/03/2018, 21:32 - Thomas Lee: Part of it is fit too
09/03/2018, 21:32 - Thomas Lee: We both know this isn't the right fit
09/03/2018, 21:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes
09/03/2018, 21:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Same for me.
09/03/2018, 21:33 - Cameron McIntyre: But it's not forever.
09/03/2018, 21:38 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
09/03/2018, 21:38 - Thomas Lee: Ian gonna tell Greg I think it's not the right fit
09/03/2018, 21:38 - Thomas Lee: Just gonna be completely candid
09/03/2018, 21:38 - Cameron McIntyre: That is fair.
09/03/2018, 21:39 - Cameron McIntyre: I think that's a good plan.
09/03/2018, 21:42 - Thomas Lee: The thing is
09/03/2018, 21:42 - Thomas Lee: He is a great fuy
09/03/2018, 21:42 - Thomas Lee: Guy

09/03/2018, 21:42 - Cameron McIntyre: Absolutely
09/03/2018, 21:42 - Thomas Lee: And I just want his honest opinion
09/03/2018, 21:42 - Cameron McIntyre: He knows ure hurting right now.
09/03/2018, 21:44 - Thomas Lee: And I rather be transparent with him
09/03/2018, 21:44 - Thomas Lee: Before Dean and Duncan
09/03/2018, 21:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes makes sense.
09/03/2018, 21:46 - Thomas Lee: You think he suspected before you spoke to him?
09/03/2018, 21:47 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't think he realised it was hitting you deep and affecting you.
10/03/2018, 10:24 - Cameron McIntyre: Did u talk to Dean and Duncan?
10/03/2018, 12:13 - Thomas Lee: No
10/03/2018, 12:13 - Thomas Lee: That'll cone after Greg

10/03/2018, 12:28 - Thomas Lee: Just pure diet
10/03/2018, 12:28 - Thomas Lee: It's painful though
10/03/2018, 12:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Sounds tough.
10/03/2018, 12:28 - Thomas Lee: Veggie lunch
10/03/2018, 12:28 - Cameron McIntyre: That might affect ure mood also.

10/03/2018, 12:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Do that good stuff I'm glad you're making progress
10/03/2018, 12:29 - Thomas Lee: But I'm probably a little edgy

10/03/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm gonna go eat some candy now
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: Lol
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe I should do what you're doing
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: I think the fasting part is important
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: But I upped my protein intake too
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: The what's the plan like
10/03/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: How long do you fast for
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: So I'm between 40 - 60g
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: Faily
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: I'm still fasting
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: Want it to be permanent
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: But 16 hr
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Do you have to be eating more than 60 grams of protein
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh it sounds like the leangains program
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: Probably
10/03/2018, 12:31 - Cameron McIntyre: You have to eat more protein than 60 grams
10/03/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: 60 grams is a lot
10/03/2018, 12:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Bro are you like 200 grams of protein a day minimum
10/03/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: At least a lot more than I was having
10/03/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: Is it really?
10/03/2018, 12:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Well I mean most people Jeremy into each one gram per pound of body weight so for me to do 200 grams is actually eating less than one pound of body weight
10/03/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: Man

10/03/2018, 12:39 - Cameron McIntyre: I've smashed a couple brown girls are actually pretty kinky
10/03/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: But I hate having to stretch pussy out
10/03/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: Not gonna do it
10/03/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: But just think about it
10/03/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: Lol
10/03/2018, 12:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude how much do you actually have to wait about pussy's being too tight
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Light is it a legitimate problem for you
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Thomas Lee: Nah
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Thomas Lee: Very rare
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Cameron McIntyre: F****** love it when it is super super tight
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Thomas Lee: But it hurts
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Only after a little while it's pretty good for the first time
10/03/2018, 12:44 - Thomas Lee: Geeks it it is going my foreskin off
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: But after
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: Nothing like it
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeah it's pretty f****** good
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: Stuff of addictions
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: It's with the cost
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Big time big big time
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: But it's his be bare
10/03/2018, 12:45 - Thomas Lee: I find condoms can hurt too
10/03/2018, 12:46 - Cameron McIntyre: I really really dislike condoms
10/03/2018, 12:46 - Cameron McIntyre: I know it's terrible but I really don't like them
10/03/2018, 12:46 - Thomas Lee: Send a little better with lube on your dick before you put it on
10/03/2018, 12:46 - Thomas Lee: I wish we had cures for all stds
10/03/2018, 12:46 - Thomas Lee: Bare everything
10/03/2018, 12:47 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeah that would be pretty f****** nice
12/03/2018, 21:24 - Cameron McIntyre: Manya asked me to reference her. I said no.
12/03/2018, 21:24 - Cameron McIntyre: I hate to be a dick
12/03/2018, 21:24 - Cameron McIntyre: But it didnt work last time.
12/03/2018, 21:24 - Cameron McIntyre: Made me look bad.
12/03/2018, 21:24 - Thomas Lee: I think it's fair
12/03/2018, 21:25 - Thomas Lee: If you aren't gonna be professional, don't expect a reference
12/03/2018, 21:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
12/03/2018, 21:25 - Thomas Lee: Doesn't matter that you're friends
12/03/2018, 21:25 - Cameron McIntyre: And like she didn't use any of the resources she could have like taking a leave of absence or actually addressing any of the method mental health issues she might have been having
12/03/2018, 21:26 - Cameron McIntyre: Way to be honest with you I haven't heard from her in over a year and even when she left RBC she did not tell me she was going or why she left that looks bad on me
12/03/2018, 21:26 - Cameron McIntyre: I think she just treats me as someone she can go to for a reference I don't think she'd appreciate how important that the job is
12/03/2018, 21:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Like I went out of my way to go and get her out of bmo and bring her into a RBC at a better pay rates in a better environment because she was decent and she just quit for no reason
12/03/2018, 21:27 - Thomas Lee: I still think she was lying about mental health
12/03/2018, 21:27 - Cameron McIntyre: So you can see with that type of  opacity in communication why I am reluctant to say she will do a great job for another employer
12/03/2018, 21:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Even if she wasn't or she was it still wasn't handled well on her behalf
12/03/2018, 21:28 - Cameron McIntyre: We strive to be one of the most forward thinking culture is about these issues and we know they are significant at some point she has to get on board with what is being offered to help her
12/03/2018, 21:29 - Thomas Lee: Yeah don't feel bad man
12/03/2018, 21:30 - Thomas Lee: You are in the right
12/03/2018, 21:30 - Thomas Lee: 100%
12/03/2018, 21:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Thanks man.
12/03/2018, 21:30 - Cameron McIntyre: I try not to be a bad guy about these things.
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Thomas Lee: But you werent
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Thomas Lee: If you didn't help her in the first place that's one thing
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Thomas Lee: But you got her the gig
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Thomas Lee: So you have nothing to feel bad about
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.
12/03/2018, 21:36 - Cameron McIntyre: Like
12/03/2018, 21:37 - Cameron McIntyre: I just don't think she's happy getting a no from me.
12/03/2018, 21:37 - Thomas Lee: Honestly she can fuck off
12/03/2018, 21:37 - Thomas Lee: Too bad
12/03/2018, 21:37 - Thomas Lee: She is an adult
12/03/2018, 21:37 - Thomas Lee: Actions have consequences
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Cameron McIntyre: I guess she has to own the consequences of her actions.
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Thomas Lee: Don't worry man
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Thomas Lee: Seriously
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Thomas Lee: Karma
12/03/2018, 21:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Ok
12/03/2018, 21:40 - Thomas Lee: But I honestly have my own resentment towards her
12/03/2018, 21:40 - Thomas Lee: She was honestly acting like a spoiled brat
12/03/2018, 21:40 - Cameron McIntyre: True
12/03/2018, 21:40 - Cameron McIntyre: I just don't know what to do in those situations
12/03/2018, 21:41 - Thomas Lee: Nothing
12/03/2018, 21:42 - Thomas Lee: You don't have time for that bullshit
12/03/2018, 21:42 - Cameron McIntyre: True
12/03/2018, 21:42 - Cameron McIntyre: Yo. U got Instagram?

12/03/2018, 21:52 - Thomas Lee: He doesn't want me to quit
12/03/2018, 21:52 - Thomas Lee: He didn't say it that way
12/03/2018, 21:52 - Thomas Lee: But I never told him I was looking either
12/03/2018, 21:53 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude no one wants you out
12/03/2018, 21:53 - Cameron McIntyre: You are pushing yourself out honestly.
12/03/2018, 21:53 - Cameron McIntyre: We gotta get together as a group and make sure u know you are doing a good job.
12/03/2018, 21:55 - Thomas Lee: That's hard
12/03/2018, 21:55 - Thomas Lee: I would feel that's patronizing
12/03/2018, 21:55 - Thomas Lee: Honestly
12/03/2018, 21:55 - Thomas Lee: You know I'm paranoid
12/03/2018, 21:55 - Thomas Lee: I'm resuming my 1 on1
12/03/2018, 21:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Good stuff men.
12/03/2018, 21:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Man*
12/03/2018, 21:57 - Cameron McIntyre: I dont want to be patronising.
12/03/2018, 21:57 - Cameron McIntyre: But it's like how do we support you and make u know that we NEED you.
12/03/2018, 21:57 - Cameron McIntyre: And that ure doing well
12/03/2018, 21:58 - Cameron McIntyre: And the amount of flack ure dealing with is normal.
12/03/2018, 21:58 - Thomas Lee: I don't know man
12/03/2018, 21:58 - Thomas Lee: If I'm good
12/03/2018, 21:58 - Thomas Lee: I wonder if I should just go consulting
12/03/2018, 21:58 - Cameron McIntyre: It would probably be easier.
12/03/2018, 21:59 - Thomas Lee: Well
12/03/2018, 22:00 - Thomas Lee: I mean if I go to big 4 or McKinsey
12/03/2018, 22:00 - Thomas Lee: Don't think it'll be easier
12/03/2018, 22:00 - Cameron McIntyre: McKinsey is a different story entirely.
12/03/2018, 22:01 - Cameron McIntyre: It's be more hours. But simpler stuff and you would never implement anything.
12/03/2018, 22:03 - Thomas Lee: I don't think I want mckinsey
12/03/2018, 22:03 - Thomas Lee: Just big 4
12/03/2018, 22:04 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
12/03/2018, 22:04 - Cameron McIntyre: I want something private.
12/03/2018, 22:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Fund or firm or something.
12/03/2018, 22:04 - Thomas Lee: That would be cool
12/03/2018, 22:05 - Thomas Lee: I don't know if I can do the expectation management party though
12/03/2018, 22:05 - Cameron McIntyre: The relationships are the best part.
12/03/2018, 22:07 - Thomas Lee: But how to exceed expectations
12/03/2018, 22:07 - Thomas Lee: Or tell them negative shit
12/03/2018, 22:08 - Cameron McIntyre: All learnable skills.
19/03/2018, 18:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Dude. I'm sick. I think I might need to stay home tomorrow.
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Thomas Lee: Ok
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Thomas Lee: Just relax
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Thomas Lee: All good
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Cameron McIntyre: Sorry to be a bitch man
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm on top of my shit
19/03/2018, 18:36 - Cameron McIntyre: But my body is fucking me right now.
19/03/2018, 18:42 - Cameron McIntyre: I'll try to work from home.
19/03/2018, 18:43 - Thomas Lee: Nah don't worry man
19/03/2018, 18:43 - Thomas Lee: If you need rest, rest
07/05/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Hey man
07/05/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: I need to work from home more.
07/05/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: The office is so depressing.
07/05/2018, 14:13 - Thomas Lee: What's going on?
07/05/2018, 14:15 - Cameron McIntyre: Nothing. Just trying to find a balance that is good for me.
07/05/2018, 14:15 - Cameron McIntyre: It's holiday today
07/05/2018, 14:15 - Cameron McIntyre: It's nice outside.
07/05/2018, 14:32 - Thomas Lee: Oh right
07/05/2018, 14:32 - Thomas Lee: Ok
07/05/2018, 14:32 - Thomas Lee: If you feel you need to wfh more
07/05/2018, 14:32 - Thomas Lee: You can
07/05/2018, 14:32 - Thomas Lee: 2 days a week?
07/05/2018, 14:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Thanks brother
07/05/2018, 14:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea 2 days max
07/05/2018, 14:36 - Cameron McIntyre: I probably won't take them every week
07/05/2018, 14:36 - Cameron McIntyre: But it makes me feel safer when I can mix it up.
07/05/2018, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: Yeah that's fine
07/05/2018, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: Would be better if the days are standardized
07/05/2018, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: If you choose not to use hem that's fine
07/05/2018, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: But probably better that's it's potentially the same days every week
07/05/2018, 14:37 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. I will try to standardize
07/05/2018, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: Cool
07/05/2018, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: Then I accept your proposal
07/05/2018, 14:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Thanks boss!!
07/05/2018, 14:40 - Cameron McIntyre: How are things with you?

07/05/2018, 14:42 - Cameron McIntyre: We all are.
07/05/2018, 14:42 - Cameron McIntyre: But all banks function like this.
07/05/2018, 14:43 - Thomas Lee: Ok
07/05/2018, 14:43 - Thomas Lee: Does he want to leave you think?
07/05/2018, 14:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Nope
07/05/2018, 14:44 - Cameron McIntyre: If ccfrs fails I think he will.
07/05/2018, 14:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Otherwise not.
07/05/2018, 14:44 - Thomas Lee: Is ccfrs that rough?
07/05/2018, 14:44 - Thomas Lee: Probably need to catch up with you on it
07/05/2018, 14:44 - Thomas Lee: To get the inside scoop
07/05/2018, 14:45 - Cameron McIntyre: It isn't.
07/05/2018, 14:45 - Cameron McIntyre: But he is frustrated.
07/05/2018, 14:45 - Cameron McIntyre: I think we are making a cardinal mistake in selling it before it is ready.
07/05/2018, 14:46 - Thomas Lee: That's our style
09/05/2018, 15:40 - Cameron McIntyre: Hey. How's it going?
09/05/2018, 15:41 - Cameron McIntyre: I decided. If you leave. I will manage.
09/05/2018, 15:41 - Cameron McIntyre: I will try to take the management role.
09/05/2018, 17:34 - Thomas Lee: You want to?
09/05/2018, 17:35 - Thomas Lee: How come?
09/05/2018, 17:37 - Cameron McIntyre: Cuz I think I could be a good manager.

09/05/2018, 17:46 - Thomas Lee: Ok that's cool
09/05/2018, 17:49 - Cameron McIntyre: But don't go
09/05/2018, 17:49 - Cameron McIntyre: Unless you are unhappy

09/05/2018, 17:49 - Thomas Lee: Yeah I'm inhappy
09/05/2018, 17:49 - Thomas Lee: I think if you take the role
09/05/2018, 17:50 - Thomas Lee: Make sure the role defined well
09/05/2018, 17:50 - Thomas Lee: It's becoming more defined now
09/05/2018, 17:50 - Thomas Lee: Do you work
09/05/2018, 17:50 - Thomas Lee: Or do you manage
09/05/2018, 17:54 - Cameron McIntyre: True say brother.

25/05/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: Umm
25/05/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: I think it's just everything
25/05/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: Then when someone asked me about getting position level TB from all systems
25/05/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: Just felt something slip

25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: Well
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe start with one system?
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: The other thing is
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: We have some of it also.
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: I don't think it's always possible
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: Sophos can
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: I think some ledgers can
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Slim sort of.
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: But I'm afraid systems that post to gl
25/05/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: Cant
25/05/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: Might be aggregate level
25/05/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: Murex can't even tap into gl
25/05/2018, 13:04 - Cameron McIntyre: That's what happens for rimms
25/05/2018, 13:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Murex should feed gl
25/05/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: I think it's through slim
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: But as part of darwin
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: They can do it directly it seems
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: But it's things like this
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: When PC and PM's make blanket statements
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: Stresses me out
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: You need to call them out
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Correct them 24/7
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Hammer it into them.
25/05/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Condition them.
25/05/2018, 13:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Because they just simplify and assume.
25/05/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: I did
25/05/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: But it freaked me out
25/05/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: Between you and me

25/05/2018, 13:08 - Thomas Lee: And I feel like I'm getting more paranoid
25/05/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: Always afraid I'm being coached
25/05/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: For remediation
25/05/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: But how is therapy
25/05/2018, 13:09 - Thomas Lee: Do you find it is working?

31/05/2018, 13:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Which assumption?
31/05/2018, 13:27 - Cameron McIntyre: To other jobs?
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: Yes to other jobs
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: And for the assumption
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: He is hiring a data validation ba
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: But they will only take his work
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: Not mine
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: He said my piece is almost done so I have to finish it
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Thomas Lee: But it's not true
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Og
31/05/2018, 13:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Have u communicated this?
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: I think it's just beginning and not even close to being source from core
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: At this point I don't care
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Get the job and get out
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: Do what I can
31/05/2018, 13:29 - Thomas Lee: The rest is not my problem
31/05/2018, 13:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Poor management poor strategy eh?
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Thomas Lee: Yep
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Thomas Lee: Uses a hands off approach
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Thomas Lee: Chooses a project that is mostly not in cores data set
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Cameron McIntyre: True
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Thomas Lee: And somehow knows the progress of the project
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Bull shit
31/05/2018, 13:31 - Thomas Lee: Yea
31/05/2018, 13:32 - Thomas Lee: I know talking about it will do little
31/05/2018, 13:32 - Thomas Lee: Doesn't listen anyways
31/05/2018, 13:32 - Thomas Lee: So waste of time
31/05/2018, 13:32 - Cameron McIntyre: True
31/05/2018, 16:41 - Thomas Lee: <Media omitted>

31/05/2018, 16:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Not good.
31/05/2018, 16:43 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh well.
31/05/2018, 16:43 - Thomas Lee: Not our problem
31/05/2018, 16:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup
12/06/2018, 16:05 - Thomas Lee: <Media omitted>

11/07/2018, 17:12 - Thomas Lee: Not seeing too much out there though
11/07/2018, 17:12 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
11/07/2018, 17:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Tough run I guess.
11/07/2018, 17:16 - Thomas Lee: I will get our eventually
11/07/2018, 17:16 - Thomas Lee: More talking through network
11/07/2018, 17:16 - Cameron McIntyre: Good plan.
11/07/2018, 17:16 - Thomas Lee: Would you be willing to move back for my role of I go?
11/07/2018, 17:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Depends.
11/07/2018, 17:17 - Cameron McIntyre: But potentially
11/07/2018, 17:17 - Thomas Lee: Fyi I haven't heard anything but just curious if that's something you are willing to do
11/07/2018, 17:17 - Thomas Lee: Ok
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: When i eventually leave
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: I would pitch for you
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Thanks man
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: I honestly think it should have been you instead of mr
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: Me*
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: I want to get an ad role.
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: Core is a tough gig though
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Well man. Things happen for a reason
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: I told Dean to split my role
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: It's a nightmare.
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea?
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Cameron McIntyre: What's he say.
11/07/2018, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: Core is kinda complex
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: He is thinking about making a team to address some related questions
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: So it's one thing to manage
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: Another to be sme
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: And another to still be a BA
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: Just doesn't work
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: Even if someone does it
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea torally
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: You are asking for burn out
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: So not sustainable
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Cameron McIntyre: You can't really do both effective ly
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Thomas Lee: In my opinion
11/07/2018, 17:19 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup.
11/07/2018, 17:20 - Thomas Lee: So they recognize that I'm overloaded
11/07/2018, 17:20 - Thomas Lee: Which is good
11/07/2018, 17:20 - Thomas Lee: But core is the hardest lead role
11/07/2018, 17:20 - Cameron McIntyre: Very true
11/07/2018, 17:20 - Thomas Lee: In my opinion
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: But like I said I think very highly of you
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: And I think if anyone can do it
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: And definitely better
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: It's you
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: But the role shouldn't be as is
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Thomas Lee: It's not effective
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Cameron McIntyre: Appreciated man
11/07/2018, 17:22 - Cameron McIntyre: But I don't think you recognise how good you are at your role
11/07/2018, 17:22 - Cameron McIntyre: You are to hard on yourself.
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: Probably
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: But
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: If you want someone at their best
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: You need focus
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: That's not what this id
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Thomas Lee: Is*
11/07/2018, 17:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Have you gone to see a therapist yet?

20/08/2018, 16:11 - Thomas Lee: But based on attitude and aptitude, you might get blasted
20/08/2018, 16:13 - Cameron McIntyre: True man
20/08/2018, 16:13 - Cameron McIntyre: It's your judgement call. It's good policy!

20/08/2018, 16:13 - Thomas Lee: Greg is so nice though
20/08/2018, 16:14 - Thomas Lee: So it can undermine that a bit
20/08/2018, 16:14 - Thomas Lee: But he has been pushing back lately too
20/08/2018, 16:14 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup
20/08/2018, 16:14 - Cameron McIntyre: He is sticking out his elbows.

20/08/2018, 16:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes.
20/08/2018, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Sometimes you just need to decide when something is unaffordable.
20/08/2018, 16:35 - Thomas Lee: Bang per buck not there
20/08/2018, 16:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes
20/08/2018, 16:35 - Thomas Lee: I'm not for the hype
20/08/2018, 16:35 - Thomas Lee: Skeptical
20/08/2018, 16:36 - Thomas Lee: Most people don't even research

20/08/2018, 16:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Some assets are smart to buy at one price and bad to buy at another
20/08/2018, 16:45 - Cameron McIntyre: It depends on the price.
20/08/2018, 16:45 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
20/08/2018, 16:45 - Thomas Lee: It was coming from a place of ignorance
20/08/2018, 16:45 - Thomas Lee: So I just went with it

21/09/2018, 22:19 - Thomas Lee: Tone to me is important
21/09/2018, 22:20 - Thomas Lee: If I don't agree
21/09/2018, 22:20 - Thomas Lee: Putt you express it a certain way
21/09/2018, 22:20 - Thomas Lee: Fine
21/09/2018, 22:20 - Thomas Lee: But if you press something forcefully that just doesn't make sense
21/09/2018, 22:20 - Thomas Lee: Meh
21/09/2018, 22:21 - Thomas Lee: I could just be biased since I've just had it

27/09/2018, 15:21 - Cameron McIntyre: Which maps to legal entity
27/09/2018, 15:21 - Thomas Lee: Ok
27/09/2018, 15:22 - Thomas Lee: Open link can't populate it
27/09/2018, 15:22 - Thomas Lee: So I'm trying to think If I allow it
27/09/2018, 15:22 - Thomas Lee: Seem like it's one of those exception cases
27/09/2018, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: And in core crcf we enrich I suppose
27/09/2018, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. If they can send transit we can enrich

27/09/2018, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: Mixed*
27/09/2018, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: What went bad?
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: Didn't answer ome car question right I rhink
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: I didn't prep tech
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: Was told not to
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Cameron McIntyre: Car question?
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: So bit of a curve ball
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: Var*
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: Sorry
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: But the manager seemed to like me
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Cameron McIntyre: What was the q?
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: Responded positively to my buddy
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: 10 yr var
27/09/2018, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: In the past month
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: Would it be flat
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: Or not
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: I totally forgot 10 yrs is 2008 time
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: True
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: My thinking was the trade wars would have added volatility
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: So it might be  bit higher
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Possible
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: But yea forgrt about 2008
27/09/2018, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Rates cranking up also add vol
27/09/2018, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
27/09/2018, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: Things are getting riskier
27/09/2018, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: But compared to loses in 2008
27/09/2018, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: It would probably be flat
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes true
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Plus 10 year var
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: The manager did so he much notice I would need to give
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Should be up on a 10 year period
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Shut
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Shut*
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Shit
27/09/2018, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Keyboard glitching
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: Yeah I said more or less flat
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: Slightly spiking
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: True
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: Manager asked how much notice I would need
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: So I have cues that's are possible
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: And some misses
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: But my competition is stiff
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Shit
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: So could break me
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Don't get down
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Just relax.
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: Nothing I can do
27/09/2018, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: Maybe it's ok
27/09/2018, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Probably
27/09/2018, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: And I'm overthinking it
27/09/2018, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea for sure.

27/09/2018, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: Overall
27/09/2018, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: But this is a game with competitors
27/09/2018, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: So

29/10/2018, 21:58 - Thomas Lee: That's the amazing part
29/10/2018, 22:21 - Thomas Lee: Man this evaluation is really pissing me off
29/10/2018, 22:22 - Cameron McIntyre: Why is that?
29/10/2018, 22:22 - Thomas Lee: It's just
29/10/2018, 22:22 - Thomas Lee: I don't know if they know what I do
29/10/2018, 22:22 - Thomas Lee: Or contribute
29/10/2018, 22:23 - Thomas Lee: Or if they are scapegoating mr

29/10/2018, 22:24 - Cameron McIntyre: How do you mean?

29/10/2018, 22:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Look
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Cameron McIntyre: I thought Dean and I would have a shitty meeting when I was there and it turned out quite well
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Make sure you advocate for yourself when u go into the meeting
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Cameron McIntyre: And thatbthey know what's what
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Thomas Lee: I'm thinking I won't say anything
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Cameron McIntyre: It is your place to diaagree
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Thomas Lee: This is from palmer
29/10/2018, 22:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe
29/10/2018, 22:30 - Cameron McIntyre: What's from him?
29/10/2018, 22:30 - Thomas Lee: Final approved are from palmer
29/10/2018, 22:30 - Cameron McIntyre: So Mike brought u down
29/10/2018, 22:30 - Thomas Lee: Maybe
29/10/2018, 22:30 - Thomas Lee: If he did
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Thomas Lee: Why
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Cameron McIntyre: If that's the case it's got nothing to do with performance
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Thomas Lee: Where is the negative feedback coming from
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Cameron McIntyre: I got knocked from 4 to 3 last year
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Cameron McIntyre: It's all budgets
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Cameron McIntyre: It has nothing to do with performance
29/10/2018, 22:31 - Cameron McIntyre: And they have to force the distribution
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Meaning they can only have a certain percentage of 4s
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Cameron McIntyre: I got knocked down last year also.
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Thomas Lee: Well I'm glad you guys got it
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Thomas Lee: Basically gave everyone in core 4
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Cameron McIntyre: He still might knock me down also.
29/10/2018, 22:32 - Cameron McIntyre: It happened last year.
29/10/2018, 22:33 - Thomas Lee: Nah
29/10/2018, 22:33 - Thomas Lee: Yours is sit

29/10/2018, 22:33 - Thomas Lee: So he is ok with the core team being outstanding
29/10/2018, 22:33 - Thomas Lee: And debbie
29/10/2018, 22:34 - Thomas Lee: It is what it is
29/10/2018, 22:34 - Cameron McIntyre: So did Dean set u at 4 or 3?
29/10/2018, 22:34 - Thomas Lee: No idea
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Cameron McIntyre: And did Palmer change ir
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Cameron McIntyre: True. Ask in your eval
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Thomas Lee: He would probably lie to me
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. I agree.
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Thomas Lee: I would think Duncan likes me enough
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Thomas Lee: Maybe not
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Thomas Lee: My UK trip was cancelled too
29/10/2018, 22:35 - Thomas Lee: So

29/10/2018, 22:37 - Thomas Lee: Still pissed

29/10/2018, 22:38 - Cameron McIntyre: He's helped me rationalize things
29/10/2018, 22:38 - Cameron McIntyre: And told me worse stories.
29/10/2018, 22:39 - Thomas Lee: Well he asked me not to quit
29/10/2018, 22:39 - Thomas Lee: So many I won't tell him this one

29/10/2018, 22:40 - Cameron McIntyre: He could give u strategy
29/10/2018, 22:40 - Cameron McIntyre: But if u want out then there is no point
29/10/2018, 22:40 - Thomas Lee: Maybe I should tell him
29/10/2018, 22:40 - Thomas Lee: I can't take this place anymore
29/10/2018, 22:41 - Cameron McIntyre: Wouldn't hurt
29/10/2018, 22:41 - Cameron McIntyre: It'll be alright.
29/10/2018, 22:41 - Cameron McIntyre: You'll find a better role.

29/10/2018, 22:42 - Thomas Lee: Too bad
29/10/2018, 22:47 - Cameron McIntyre: It is performance based

31/10/2018, 13:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Of course
31/10/2018, 13:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Sounds like a good opportunity
31/10/2018, 13:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Any idea about the courses I put in for?
31/10/2018, 13:01 - Thomas Lee: It's just a temp solution
31/10/2018, 13:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. But you'd make bank.
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: I was gonna ask Dean about it today
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: During my lunch with him
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: True sounds good
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: I of course want too
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Tell him it's a new view on attacking our problems
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: But the budget constraints
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: And it will keep me highly engaged
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Cameron McIntyre: True
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: I'm worried if I ask duncan
31/10/2018, 13:02 - Thomas Lee: He wont
31/10/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
31/10/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: True
31/10/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: He was asking about general practice for cfa
31/10/2018, 13:03 - Thomas Lee: Like what happened at scotia
31/10/2018, 13:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh
31/10/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: So rojina claimed her courses
31/10/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: She had it approved in the past
31/10/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: And Dean said it was fine
31/10/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: So there was precedent
31/10/2018, 13:04 - Thomas Lee: But with budget constraints, I thought they might clamp down
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes we will see
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: Yours is a little bit of a specialized case
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: And they have approved also before
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: So we'll see
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: Yeah so
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Thomas Lee: Again precedence is helpful
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
31/10/2018, 13:05 - Cameron McIntyre: Also it's a forward way of thinking for our business problems.
31/10/2018, 13:06 - Cameron McIntyre: And it's much cheaper than hiring consultants.
31/10/2018, 13:06 - Thomas Lee: Yes

11/12/2018, 13:55 - Cameron McIntyre: That is a good sign. :)
11/12/2018, 13:55 - Cameron McIntyre: Great things in the new year!
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Thomas Lee: Hopefully less stressful
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Thomas Lee: But I think for you
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Thomas Lee: Watch yourself here
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Thomas Lee: I expect turbulence
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. I'm expecting it.
11/12/2018, 13:56 - Cameron McIntyre: A vacuum
11/12/2018, 13:57 - Thomas Lee: Not sure if there will be more resignations on the 21st here
11/12/2018, 13:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Probably
11/12/2018, 13:57 - Cameron McIntyre: But who knows.
11/12/2018, 13:58 - Cameron McIntyre: I certainly don't know what will happen.
11/12/2018, 14:12 - Thomas Lee: I'm not sure how long Duncan will stick around
11/12/2018, 14:12 - Cameron McIntyre: What do you think the effect will be if he leaves.
11/12/2018, 14:16 - Thomas Lee: The BA space will be in disarray
11/12/2018, 14:16 - Thomas Lee: Potentially Billings will have to the over at first
11/12/2018, 14:16 - Thomas Lee: Our shelter from the business will be gone
11/12/2018, 14:16 - Thomas Lee: So a lot more raging
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Interesting
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Thomas Lee: And potentially more requirements creep
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Doesn't sound good.
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Thomas Lee: I don't think Mike p will take an active role
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Thomas Lee: Maybe Helen Loi will step in
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Thomas Lee: Not sure
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Man. It's crqzy
11/12/2018, 14:17 - Cameron McIntyre: I just don't know.
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Thomas Lee: It will be weird
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Thomas Lee: And unorganized for a bit
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Fml
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Makes me want out.
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Thomas Lee: I know a re shovel is coming
11/12/2018, 14:18 - Thomas Lee: I think there are org changes coming as well
11/12/2018, 14:19 - Cameron McIntyre: Man.
11/12/2018, 14:19 - Cameron McIntyre: This is an interesting time.
11/12/2018, 14:33 - Thomas Lee: That's one way to put it
11/12/2018, 14:33 - Thomas Lee: How are you?
11/12/2018, 14:33 - Thomas Lee: How did your pitch go?
11/12/2018, 14:33 - Cameron McIntyre: I am ok.
13/12/2018, 12:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Hey man. How's it going?
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Do u want to do 1:1 or just put it off.
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: Oh shit
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm good with either
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: Forgot about it
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: Put it off
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Thomas Lee: I have a bank appointment at 8 my time actually
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Sounds good. That was what I was hoping.
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Cool

13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: U set up your company yet?
13/12/2018, 12:30 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea I agree.

13/12/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: Morning*
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Cameron McIntyre: You'll be the bay Street king soon.
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: I set an appointment with a therapist too
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: Haha
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Very very good
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: As long as I get decent pay with less stress
13/12/2018, 12:31 - Thomas Lee: All good
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm happy you are taking action:)
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: See where it goes
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: A little skeptical
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: But trying to be open
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Cameron McIntyre: That's totally fine
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Just be honest.
13/12/2018, 12:32 - Thomas Lee: I just know this wiring is tough to rewire
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Cameron McIntyre: I know.
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: So more worried about my own commitment to cause
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Cameron McIntyre: It's a noble pursuit though
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: Rather than the therapist
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Better to try.
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: Hopefully this therapist is good
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Cameron McIntyre: How did you find?
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: I don't want to have to go threw many
13/12/2018, 12:33 - Thomas Lee: Debbie
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Thomas Lee: Her daughter is similar to me
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Thomas Lee: And it's helping her
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Awesome
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Man. It takes time.
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Thomas Lee: So seems like there is a potential for help
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Cameron McIntyre: There Def is
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Thomas Lee: I wish I actually knew less about paychology
13/12/2018, 12:34 - Thomas Lee: Psychology*
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: I feel like because I know a little
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: I will be prejudice
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: And a little difficult
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea I know what u mean.
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: Hopefully not
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: How are you doing?
13/12/2018, 12:35 - Thomas Lee: All good?
13/12/2018, 12:36 - Thomas Lee: Recovered from your cold?
13/12/2018, 12:36 - Cameron McIntyre: It's tough man. I think I am fine. But there's always lingering issues.
13/12/2018, 12:36 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea I'm over the cold.
13/12/2018, 12:36 - Thomas Lee: I wish it was just a quick fix
13/12/2018, 12:36 - Thomas Lee: But the scary thing is that it is probably a life long effort
13/12/2018, 12:37 - Cameron McIntyre: You'd be surprised how empowering it is to engage with problems this big.
13/12/2018, 12:37 - Thomas Lee: True
13/12/2018, 12:38 - Thomas Lee: I'm hoping to at least get stress management out of it
13/12/2018, 12:38 - Cameron McIntyre: You will.
13/12/2018, 12:38 - Cameron McIntyre: It's a skill. And being able to anticipate
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: So what are your thoughts about working here after January?
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Thomas Lee: Little worried?
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. Always.
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Even as it is.
13/12/2018, 12:39 - Cameron McIntyre: Without the turnover
13/12/2018, 12:40 - Thomas Lee: I can't get a read on duncan
13/12/2018, 12:40 - Thomas Lee: Can't tell when he is going

27/12/2018, 23:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Good stuff
27/12/2018, 23:02 - Thomas Lee: But only 1 visit
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Thomas Lee: So let's see
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Thomas Lee: It's good that is fully covered
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Takes quite a while.
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. Definitely
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Thomas Lee: Yes I bet
27/12/2018, 23:03 - Thomas Lee: Not easy to rewire
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Will take a few months
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Cameron McIntyre: How do u feel looking back?
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Bitter?
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Thomas Lee: Not entirely
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Thomas Lee: Good learning experience
27/12/2018, 23:04 - Thomas Lee: But
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: Toxic environment
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: London is fortunately a little detached
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: You don't have to see all of it
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Cameron McIntyre: You are right
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Cameron McIntyre: I am lucky because of that.
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: But not sure what is gonna happen now
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: Since Dean and I are gond
27/12/2018, 23:05 - Thomas Lee: Gone*
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Thomas Lee: Duncan is very only a matter of time
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Dean resigned also?
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Duncan is gone soon.
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Shit
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Thomas Lee: Told me I should go
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Thomas Lee: Didn't try to keep me
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Cameron McIntyre: I agree with him.
27/12/2018, 23:06 - Thomas Lee: Told me with my skills I can do a lot
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Thomas Lee: Thought i was going to front officr
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Thomas Lee: Really nice to hear it from him
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Cameron McIntyre: You'd do well there.
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm to much of an oddball to end up there.
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm afraid.
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Thomas Lee: Might not be worth the stress
27/12/2018, 23:07 - Thomas Lee: Contract BA is better for money
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Yeaaaa
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: Charge 125?/hr
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Def
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: Easy days
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: Honestly
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Is that what you bill at?
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: Front office isn't worth the hype
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: No
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: But that's what Duncan said I should
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Thomas Lee: So what happens in the future
27/12/2018, 23:08 - Cameron McIntyre: You're worth more
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Can't wait to hear how you are in 3 months
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Thomas Lee: Hopefully oo
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Thomas Lee: Ok
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Stacking cash and feeling good!!
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Thomas Lee: The economy might not be
27/12/2018, 23:09 - Thomas Lee: So I have to be careful
27/12/2018, 23:10 - Cameron McIntyre: Finance is always fine.
27/12/2018, 23:10 - Thomas Lee: How are you doing?
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Meh
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Little nervous now u guys are out
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Thomas Lee: What's wrong?
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: But it's good to be home
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm fine.
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Thomas Lee: Why nervous?
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Because
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: You were good managers
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Thomas Lee: I don't think we were protecting yiu
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Now you are gone.
27/12/2018, 23:11 - Cameron McIntyre: And no matter what happens
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: No idea who will come
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Cameron McIntyre: It won't be much better
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: They weren't going to offer my position to anyone
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: Probably external
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Makes me think I need a 6 month exit plan
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Cameron McIntyre: FML
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Ok
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: With Duncan going
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: Who knows
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes
27/12/2018, 23:12 - Thomas Lee: I don't care for Jason Billings

27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: True.
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: Who knows
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: The management is out the door
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Thomas Lee: The problem is palmer
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: I'm really happy for you
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: I know
27/12/2018, 23:14 - Cameron McIntyre: I gotta run

09/01/2019, 14:35 - Thomas Lee: been hearing that a lot lately
09/01/2019, 14:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol
09/01/2019, 14:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Humans are the reason for living.
09/01/2019, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: man people just need to leave me alone
09/01/2019, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: lol

09/01/2019, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: she was like
09/01/2019, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: your therapist will tell you to get in a relationship
09/01/2019, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: i told her
09/01/2019, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: thats not her job
09/01/2019, 14:37 - Thomas Lee: she guides me to what i want for fulfilment
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: which is not necessarily a relationship
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: lol
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Cameron McIntyre: You are correct
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Cameron McIntyre: On all fronts
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: she couldn't handle that respones
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Cameron McIntyre: But give it time.
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: i think a lot of people think therapy is like a drug, it immediate fixes what they think is wrong
09/01/2019, 14:38 - Thomas Lee: but its not that at all
09/01/2019, 14:39 - Thomas Lee: its changing habits and giving you the tools to deal with the problems you face in a productive way
09/01/2019, 14:39 - Thomas Lee: there is no objective solution
09/01/2019, 14:39 - Thomas Lee: how is your therapy going?
09/01/2019, 14:40 - Cameron McIntyre: It's been on pause
09/01/2019, 14:40 - Cameron McIntyre: Haven't been back since I got back from London
09/01/2019, 14:41 - Cameron McIntyre: Things are quite nice right now with the girlfriend and such.
09/01/2019, 14:41 - Cameron McIntyre: And meh for work.
09/01/2019, 14:41 - Cameron McIntyre: So I'll just let it pass.
09/01/2019, 14:55 - Thomas Lee: are you feeling any difference at work now with Dean and I gone?
09/01/2019, 14:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes. In the dark
09/01/2019, 14:57 - Cameron McIntyre: Oh well. This is life.
09/01/2019, 14:58 - Thomas Lee: i guess duncan isn't saying anything
09/01/2019, 14:58 - Thomas Lee: did you ask him about your promotion?
09/01/2019, 14:58 - Thomas Lee: for your role or taking mine?
09/01/2019, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: I haven't yet
09/01/2019, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't know where his head is ar
09/01/2019, 15:02 - Cameron McIntyre: He says things close to the vest
09/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: yeah i dont know
09/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: apparently he has dean's replacement
09/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: someone from T&O
09/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: but not finance IT
09/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: no idea who it is
09/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
09/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: He mentioned that in the back wall staff meeting.
09/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: No idea who it is
09/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: I honestly don't know if this is a good department
09/01/2019, 15:08 - Thomas Lee: It's not
09/01/2019, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: So I will just chill I think
09/01/2019, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Invest in myself
09/01/2019, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Focus on school.
09/01/2019, 15:11 - Cameron McIntyre: And my relationship
09/01/2019, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: yeah your situation is harder being in london
09/01/2019, 15:12 - Thomas Lee: you always have gre
09/01/2019, 15:12 - Thomas Lee: greg*
09/01/2019, 16:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes man
09/01/2019, 16:08 - Cameron McIntyre: It gets me down at times.
09/01/2019, 16:09 - Cameron McIntyre: Greg is greatly but he over engineering things
09/01/2019, 16:10 - Thomas Lee: i guess he is just trying to future proof some stuff
09/01/2019, 16:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. That's my guess
09/01/2019, 16:25 - Cameron McIntyre: We will see what happens
11/01/2019, 14:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Duncan just resigned
11/01/2019, 14:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Called it
11/01/2019, 14:31 - Thomas Lee: wow
11/01/2019, 14:31 - Thomas Lee: did he say where he is going?
11/01/2019, 14:35 - Cameron McIntyre: Nope
11/01/2019, 14:36 - Thomas Lee: do we know if it is at least internal?
11/01/2019, 14:39 - Cameron McIntyre: I think he's walking away.
11/01/2019, 14:42 - Thomas Lee: no job?
11/01/2019, 14:42 - Thomas Lee: how did you find out
11/01/2019, 14:42 - Thomas Lee: email?
11/01/2019, 14:45 - Cameron McIntyre: I guess so
11/01/2019, 14:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Greg told me. Duncan called Greg.
11/01/2019, 14:45 - Thomas Lee: oh damn
11/01/2019, 14:45 - Thomas Lee: is greg pretty silent about it?
11/01/2019, 14:46 - Cameron McIntyre: It happened 3 minutes ago
11/01/2019, 14:50 - Thomas Lee: damn
11/01/2019, 14:50 - Thomas Lee: well good for duncan
11/01/2019, 14:50 - Thomas Lee: he needed to go
11/01/2019, 14:52 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea man.
11/01/2019, 14:53 - Thomas Lee: pressure is on greg now for sure
11/01/2019, 14:53 - Thomas Lee: i guess Billings will take over for now
11/01/2019, 14:53 - Thomas Lee: like he wanted to
11/01/2019, 14:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
11/01/2019, 14:54 - Cameron McIntyre: He sounds political
11/01/2019, 14:54 - Cameron McIntyre: I doubt we will surge at light speed
11/01/2019, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: seemed like with the ne worg change that he wanted
11/01/2019, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: that Duncan and Dean wouldn't be part of the team
11/01/2019, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: or needed at all
11/01/2019, 14:56 - Thomas Lee: it would all just roll to Billings
11/01/2019, 14:57 - Cameron McIntyre: We will see
11/01/2019, 14:59 - Thomas Lee: interesting time now
11/01/2019, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
11/01/2019, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Well.
11/01/2019, 15:01 - Cameron McIntyre: U just got stack that ££

11/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: nest egg?
11/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: oh
11/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: i see
11/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: yeah i gotta save money carefully now
11/01/2019, 15:03 - Thomas Lee: probably dump into real estate as a retirement plan potentially
11/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. I would be careful. It can be cyclical
11/01/2019, 15:08 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe bury it in a REIT
11/01/2019, 15:08 - Cameron McIntyre: High dividends. Nice yields.
11/01/2019, 15:08 - Thomas Lee: yeah
11/01/2019, 15:08 - Thomas Lee: i'm just worried about real estate in general
11/01/2019, 15:08 - Thomas Lee: but its the easiest place to dump large capital
11/01/2019, 15:12 - Cameron McIntyre: It's actually a pain in the ass to deal with
11/01/2019, 15:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Expensive as fuck to transact
11/01/2019, 15:13 - Cameron McIntyre: Huge tax pains
11/01/2019, 15:13 - Cameron McIntyre: Competitive market
11/01/2019, 15:13 - Cameron McIntyre: High leverage
11/01/2019, 15:13 - Cameron McIntyre: And 30 year horizon.
11/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: yeah
11/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: i hate buying real estate
11/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: with a passion
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: So just buy a REIT
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Collect 7% dividend and capital appreciation
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: And chill
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Never have to talk to a lawyer
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Never get tenants
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Or kijiji
11/01/2019, 15:32 - Cameron McIntyre: Like fuck all of that.
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: yeah
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: such a pain
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: is Greg talking to you about Duncan?
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Cameron McIntyre: No
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Cameron McIntyre: Greg is always tight lipped
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Cameron McIntyre: He's hard to crack
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: yeah
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Cameron McIntyre: But he can open up
11/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: does he look stressed?
11/01/2019, 15:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Not really
11/01/2019, 15:34 - Cameron McIntyre: Not enough time has passed.
11/01/2019, 15:34 - Thomas Lee: he has been anticipating this anyways
11/01/2019, 15:38 - Cameron McIntyre: Yes
16/01/2019, 15:06 - Thomas Lee: Heard Duncan is gone by the end of the month
16/01/2019, 15:07 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. That's about the size of it.
16/01/2019, 15:08 - Thomas Lee: What do you think?
16/01/2019, 15:10 - Cameron McIntyre: His dad died over the break
16/01/2019, 15:10 - Cameron McIntyre: So
16/01/2019, 15:10 - Cameron McIntyre: Go figure
16/01/2019, 15:10 - Cameron McIntyre: How r u man?
16/01/2019, 15:10 - Thomas Lee: I'm okay
16/01/2019, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Personal life feels weird
16/01/2019, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Still not talking with at that friend who disputed looks over confidence
16/01/2019, 15:11 - Thomas Lee: Trying to push past it and not care
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Cameron McIntyre: Good plan man
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Cameron McIntyre: Carve out your own space
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Cameron McIntyre: There's a phrase I like
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Thomas Lee: Trying to use the teachings from therapy
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Thomas Lee: Its hard though
16/01/2019, 15:14 - Thomas Lee: Need practice
16/01/2019, 15:15 - Thomas Lee: How are you?
16/01/2019, 15:15 - Cameron McIntyre: I think it's biblical "don't follow the masses to do evil"
16/01/2019, 15:15 - Cameron McIntyre: I am ok. Nervous about work.
16/01/2019, 15:15 - Cameron McIntyre: If it will get more stress
16/01/2019, 15:15 - Cameron McIntyre: If I will get fired.
16/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Just looked at housing prices in toronto
16/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Murderously high.
16/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Tough world to navigate.
16/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: Toronto is expensive, but there are areas on the bloor line that are a little cheaper but neighborhoods aren't as nice for now.
16/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: Are you worried about being fired?
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: True
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't know
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: It's always in the back of my head
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: Word is Duncan might change industries
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: What make you think they would?
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: Maybe he is on to something.
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Cameron McIntyre: He mentioned to Greg.
16/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: Out of finance?
16/01/2019, 15:21 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Maybe.
16/01/2019, 15:21 - Thomas Lee: Interesting
16/01/2019, 15:26 - Cameron McIntyre: How is your new gig?
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Its alright
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Not much support
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Micro manager
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: But meh
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: Get that check
16/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: True
16/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: See if you can get some distance from the manager.
16/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
16/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: I'm debating whether I wanna get close to the team
16/01/2019, 15:33 - Thomas Lee: Or keep it professional too
16/01/2019, 15:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Getting close only helps you
16/01/2019, 15:44 - Cameron McIntyre: Because they will keep u around.
16/01/2019, 15:44 - Cameron McIntyre: And the money keeps flowing.
16/01/2019, 15:44 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
16/01/2019, 15:44 - Thomas Lee: Contract ends in april
16/01/2019, 15:45 - Thomas Lee: Wondering when I should start scoping our other contracts in case
16/01/2019, 15:45 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Remember everything happens last second in banks
16/01/2019, 15:45 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
16/01/2019, 15:46 - Thomas Lee: Need to have a back up
16/01/2019, 15:49 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. And last second at Scotia they could keep u
16/01/2019, 15:50 - Cameron McIntyre: Just keep 6 month expenses in the bank
16/01/2019, 15:50 - Thomas Lee: Yeah
16/01/2019, 15:50 - Cameron McIntyre: You'll be fine. Even in the worst labor markets
16/01/2019, 15:50 - Thomas Lee: Trying to change my spending habits to a minimal
16/01/2019, 15:51 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. Once you have a bad stock you should be fine
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Yo
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Can I ask
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Thomas Lee: whats up
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Cameron McIntyre: What was everyone paid in our group at RBC?
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Cameron McIntyre: I thought Colin and I were the same
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Thomas Lee: different
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Thomas Lee: umm
17/01/2019, 18:54 - Cameron McIntyre: Because Dean sent me his bonus letter last year as a mistake
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Thomas Lee: well colins probably changed after
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Thomas Lee: once he went on his retirement schedule
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Thomas Lee: i forgot the number
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Thomas Lee: 75k
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Cameron McIntyre: True
17/01/2019, 18:55 - Thomas Lee: i think
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: bonus letter won't really tell you the pay in uk though
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: its discretionary
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: no guidelines
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Cameron McIntyre: What about like rojina Chris Steven etc
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: not like toronto
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: steven is a different level
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. I know about London.
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Thomas Lee: one lower
17/01/2019, 18:56 - Cameron McIntyre: True

17/01/2019, 18:57 - Cameron McIntyre: When I saw Colin he was 1 k more than me.
17/01/2019, 18:57 - Thomas Lee: basically its not 80 for seniors
17/01/2019, 18:57 - Thomas Lee: an dif you are new

17/01/2019, 18:57 - Thomas Lee: colin isn't that high
17/01/2019, 18:58 - Thomas Lee: i would have expected a bigger different
17/01/2019, 18:58 - Thomas Lee: difference*
17/01/2019, 18:58 - Thomas Lee: with his seniority
17/01/2019, 18:58 - Thomas Lee: and annual raises
17/01/2019, 18:58 - Thomas Lee: but it wasn't

17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: you and I were on the high end
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: basically at the limit
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: at least in toronto
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: london is different
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: different game
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Cameron McIntyre: Good on you for setting up your company and making a run for it
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: i'm sure duncan and dean had some guidelines
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: but they didn't let me know
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. The pay bands.
17/01/2019, 18:59 - Thomas Lee: Dean just showed me the numbers
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: and i approved
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: and we boosted yours
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: some more money went back into the pot
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: to got you a little more
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Cameron McIntyre: You're to kind sir.
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: ragu was on the lower end
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: he was at 71
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: so
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: he begged for a raise
17/01/2019, 19:00 - Thomas Lee: and he got it
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Cameron McIntyre: True
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: the raises are meant to bring the people within a level to parity
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Cameron McIntyre: Was he worth it though?
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: if management thinks you perform
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: i don't think so
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Cameron McIntyre: True
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: duncan and dean did it
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Cameron McIntyre: I agree
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: but i told them i was annoyed
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: ragu asked me everyday
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: then when he got it
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: he started bragging to everyone
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: and a girl on the floor is is trying to hit on
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: so after thta
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: i really dislike him
17/01/2019, 19:01 - Thomas Lee: and i dont' hide it
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Cameron McIntyre: He is such a fucktard
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: i get that you can be excited
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: and you want to tell people
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: but
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: its i guess the way he does it
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Perfect example of someone who gets promoted to the point of incompetence.
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: like
17/01/2019, 19:02 - Thomas Lee: cocky
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: when he said he wanted the AD role
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: but no reports
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: just made me mad
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: told him
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: you would pitch this to palmer
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Cameron McIntyre: Do u think it's a cultural thing? The bragging?
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: what value would he see in it
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: i'm sure its part of it
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: and then him as an individual adds on top
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Cameron McIntyre: True
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Man
17/01/2019, 19:03 - Thomas Lee: when he got the raise
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: i tried to level set him
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: i told him
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: its because you were underpaid
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: and this is just parity
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: and it has nothing to do with your performance level
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: i told him
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: i hope he gets management one day
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: so he get see this side
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Thomas Lee: and reset himself
17/01/2019, 19:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Lol
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Cameron McIntyre: I find he just has like no redeeming qualities
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: it is a good way to learn though
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: to try it
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: to really know
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Cameron McIntyre: He's such a dumbo
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: i just dont' respect him
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: thats it
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: and i'm okay with it
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: i don't have to deal with it anymore
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: so whatever
17/01/2019, 19:05 - Thomas Lee: what do you ask about pay though
17/01/2019, 19:06 - Thomas Lee: whats got you concerned?

17/01/2019, 19:07 - Cameron McIntyre: In general
17/01/2019, 19:07 - Cameron McIntyre: Nothing specific
17/01/2019, 19:07 - Thomas Lee: oh

17/01/2019, 19:10 - Thomas Lee: honest with this stuff
17/01/2019, 19:10 - Thomas Lee: i want people to see the bad before the good
17/01/2019, 19:10 - Cameron McIntyre: This is a good policy
17/01/2019, 19:10 - Thomas Lee: i would want to be more aware of the challenges i'm going to fix rather than the benefits
17/01/2019, 19:10 - Thomas Lee: its just better prep
21/01/2019, 17:03 - Thomas Lee: how are things
21/01/2019, 17:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Meh

21/01/2019, 17:22 - Cameron McIntyre: She left it last second.
21/01/2019, 17:22 - Cameron McIntyre: I wish she didnt
21/01/2019, 17:23 - Thomas Lee: Ah
21/01/2019, 17:23 - Cameron McIntyre: Then we would have had more time.
21/01/2019, 17:23 - Cameron McIntyre: My psychology analysis wasnt that good haha.
21/01/2019, 17:23 - Thomas Lee: Lol
25/01/2019, 15:13 - Thomas Lee: hows it going
25/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Same bull
25/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Hbu?
25/01/2019, 15:17 - Cameron McIntyre: Kicking back as a contractor?
25/01/2019, 15:17 - Thomas Lee: yes and no
25/01/2019, 15:17 - Thomas Lee: its busy now
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Thomas Lee: but its focused
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Thomas Lee: takes some adjusting
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Thomas Lee: that i'm not answering questions all day
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Thomas Lee: question for you
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Cameron McIntyre: That's great
25/01/2019, 15:18 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup
25/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: so in terms of mental health
25/01/2019, 15:19 - Thomas Lee: its important to make sure we don't internal problems that are out of our control
25/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: do you find that when you pull away from those problems, it can come off as callous, or insensitive when the problems are from friends?
25/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: for example
25/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: lets say a friend is having relationship problems
25/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: do you get involved or not
25/01/2019, 15:20 - Thomas Lee: and if you back away since its not your problem to solve, is that insensitive
25/01/2019, 15:21 - Cameron McIntyre: Are they asking for help? And generally I don't think so.
25/01/2019, 15:21 - Thomas Lee: lets say in both cases
25/01/2019, 15:21 - Cameron McIntyre: You can't be figuring out everyone's solutions
25/01/2019, 15:21 - Thomas Lee: like i feel like you should just let it run its course
25/01/2019, 15:22 - Cameron McIntyre: If they are asking for help, I would direct them to get help.
25/01/2019, 15:22 - Thomas Lee: no matter how bad
25/01/2019, 15:22 - Thomas Lee: there are certain things you can do if someone is in danger
25/01/2019, 15:22 - Cameron McIntyre: If they are not asking for help, it's trickier. Generally I would let them exercise their free will.
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: If someone is in immanent danger
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: I would be proactive.
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: i've been finding that the more i try and pull away the emotions from my decisions, things are getting healthier
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: If there was a crime also.
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: and i remove the problems that i can't control
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: That's usually the case
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: and i find i judge my actions with analogies
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Thomas Lee: i'll give an extreme cases
25/01/2019, 15:23 - Cameron McIntyre: You also get some breathing room. To help yourself heal.
25/01/2019, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: lets say a married couple you know has an issue with domestic violence
25/01/2019, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: do you call the cops
25/01/2019, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: or do you try and fix it without the authorities
25/01/2019, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: if we were to see this action with strangers, you would probably call the authorities
25/01/2019, 15:24 - Thomas Lee: but if its friends
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: should you do the same thing?
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: it would seem, if its a crime, its a crime
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Honestly I would call the cops.
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: doesn't necessarily matter that there is a friendship there if harm is happening
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: yeah
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Like fuck if they are friends.
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't care
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: so my doctor friend
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Thomas Lee: this is what happened to her recently
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: I live in a non violent world.
25/01/2019, 15:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: so i told her don't be afraid to escalate
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: she didn't receive the violence
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: it was her friends
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: and i told her not to make this her problem
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: you can get the girl out of danger and do you part
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: and then they have to solve their relationship on their own
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: thats when she flipped out on me
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: and saved she needs to protect
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Thomas Lee: and that i should take care of myself first
25/01/2019, 15:26 - Cameron McIntyre: The cops do the protecting.
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: so i didn't take it personally
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: That's what they are paid for.
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Serve and protect.
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: since i know her circumstance is causing teh negativity
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: yeah
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: see we are on the same page
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: but now she is not really talking to me
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: probably because i told her something she didn't want to hear
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Ask her if she has ever been punched in the jaw?
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Or been concussed
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Or had a black eye
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: so the reason i ask the question
25/01/2019, 15:27 - Thomas Lee: did i err?
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: i don't think i did
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't think so
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: i think i just took the emotion out of it
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: and acted rationally
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: Women are usually more violent than men. And emotional
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: she is generally not
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: and i have noticed that she is a lot more stress lately
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: not something she shows
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: The thing is they never hit hard enough to cause significant damage
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: so i told her to talk to someone
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: like i am
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: to help with that
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: True
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: but
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: she is a doctor
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Cameron McIntyre: I've called the cops on a girl before.
25/01/2019, 15:28 - Thomas Lee: her ego is getting in the way
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: True
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: i thinks obvious
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: violence = cops
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: All are equal in the eyes of the law.
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: Yup
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: its not complicated
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Cameron McIntyre: ESP in my case.
25/01/2019, 15:29 - Thomas Lee: its just emotions make it

25/01/2019, 15:30 - Thomas Lee: to make sure that the teachings aren't just bogus
25/01/2019, 15:30 - Thomas Lee: my mantra is basically become a psychopath
25/01/2019, 15:30 - Thomas Lee: cold and calculating
25/01/2019, 15:30 - Thomas Lee: my actions are my own, i'm in control, not my emotions
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Cameron McIntyre: It's the opposite of psychopath
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Thomas Lee: slowly trying to take back control
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Cameron McIntyre: It's more stoic
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Cameron McIntyre: It's the art of not giving a fuck.
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Thomas Lee: just being pure logic
25/01/2019, 15:31 - Cameron McIntyre: And negotiating what you want.

12/02/2019, 21:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Anyways
12/02/2019, 21:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Honestly
12/02/2019, 21:04 - Cameron McIntyre: Greg is getting on my nerves.
12/02/2019, 21:05 - Cameron McIntyre: We have built a product
12/02/2019, 21:05 - Cameron McIntyre: And it's to both of out knowledge limits
12/02/2019, 21:05 - Cameron McIntyre: And now it's breaking.
12/02/2019, 21:05 - Cameron McIntyre: And he makes up the solution
12/02/2019, 21:05 - Cameron McIntyre: And it's not reliable
12/02/2019, 21:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Or correct. It's a fucking guess's and he sells it like a fact.
12/02/2019, 21:06 - Cameron McIntyre: Hey built an over complicated system. And it's breaking.
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: well thats the problem being an authority
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: he is jsut being a leader
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: and coming down with a direction
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: just get off the project
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: as a lead
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: you might not have to deal with that as much
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: you can define the way you want to build as well
12/02/2019, 21:07 - Thomas Lee: and not necessarily go with what greg says
12/02/2019, 21:49 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea
12/02/2019, 21:49 - Cameron McIntyre: I have a meeting with biljana tomorrow. Might try to get the manager job.

18/03/2019, 16:56 - Cameron McIntyre: They seem fine to me. Very very corporate
18/03/2019, 16:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Less gritty.
18/03/2019, 16:56 - Cameron McIntyre: They don't seem emotional
18/03/2019, 16:56 - Cameron McIntyre: I'll just let them lead and sit back
18/03/2019, 16:56 - Thomas Lee: They are buddies
18/03/2019, 16:56 - Cameron McIntyre: Fyi my phone might die.
18/03/2019, 16:57 - Thomas Lee: Its good if they arent emotional
18/03/2019, 16:57 - Thomas Lee: But are they making things better?

18/03/2019, 17:02 - Cameron McIntyre: Scotia no good?
18/03/2019, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: just this project
18/03/2019, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: poor management
18/03/2019, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: they have no idea what they are doing
18/03/2019, 17:02 - Thomas Lee: not willing to listen
18/03/2019, 17:03 - Thomas Lee: so
18/03/2019, 17:03 - Thomas Lee: feels bad
18/03/2019, 17:09 - Cameron McIntyre: True
18/03/2019, 17:09 - Cameron McIntyre: That sucks.
18/03/2019, 17:09 - Cameron McIntyre: I think it is the state of the industry
18/03/2019, 17:10 - Thomas Lee: garbage
18/03/2019, 17:10 - Thomas Lee: lots of cuts
18/03/2019, 17:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Cuts in terms of what?
18/03/2019, 17:11 - Cameron McIntyre: Ppl or budget?
18/03/2019, 17:11 - Thomas Lee: both
18/03/2019, 17:12 - Cameron McIntyre: Weird
18/03/2019, 17:12 - Cameron McIntyre: I thought they were spending like mad there
18/03/2019, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: i think it depends
18/03/2019, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: its probably IT in general has been cut
18/03/2019, 17:18 - Thomas Lee: but more focused spending in key areas
18/03/2019, 17:21 - Cameron McIntyre: How are you doing though
18/03/2019, 17:21 - Cameron McIntyre: How's your outlook
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Cameron McIntyre: Also. If I don't respond don't take it as disrespectful. Phones almost dead lol

18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: no problem
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: i'm ok
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: therapy i think is helping
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: but its a long road
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: need to keep up with the work on my end
18/03/2019, 17:22 - Thomas Lee: i might even need to switch back to FTE
18/03/2019, 17:23 - Thomas Lee: depending on the marke
18/03/2019, 17:23 - Thomas Lee: greg added me on linkedin yesterday
18/03/2019, 17:23 - Thomas Lee: was a little surprised about that
18/03/2019, 17:25 - Cameron McIntyre: That's cool
18/03/2019, 17:25 - Cameron McIntyre: I think Greg might be cooking up a movr
18/03/2019, 17:25 - Cameron McIntyre: Idk tho
18/03/2019, 17:25 - Cameron McIntyre: My girlfriend is on CBT therapy. She just started she likes it.
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Cameron McIntyre: It's interesting
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: therapy is useful as long as you commit to the effort required by the individual
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: and you trust the therapist you see
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: its a complicated process
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea.
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Cameron McIntyre: Takes time.
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: i guess if greg moves
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: its in rbc
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: thought he wanted to stay for the pension
18/03/2019, 17:26 - Thomas Lee: but perhaps after selling the house, he isn't as concerned
18/03/2019, 17:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Yea. I think he did good
18/03/2019, 17:27 - Cameron McIntyre: But I think he is probably set for pension b
18/03/2019, 17:27 - Cameron McIntyre: He has had great jobs through the 90s
18/03/2019, 17:27 - Cameron McIntyre: Ppl don't make money like that anymore.
18/03/2019, 17:28 - Thomas Lee: yeah

18/03/2019, 17:28 - Cameron McIntyre: I don't think so
18/03/2019, 17:28 - Thomas Lee: i know he wanted to bring his daughter over
18/03/2019, 17:28 - Cameron McIntyre: All the traditions are gone
